#---------- ABOUT ----------#

Who is Mun?

I am a First-Generation college student studying Business Analytics and Entrepreneurship at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
My main focus is in the Heath Integrated Business and Engineering honors program associated with the Haslam College of Business and 
the Tickle College of Engineering. In this program, high-achieving business and engineering students are selected to work on real-world projects in cross-functional teams. The cohort attends classes designed around this curriculum and culminates the knowledge with internship experience and a specialty senior design project their final year with the Interdisiplinary Senior Design program.

My experience spans several years of professional and academic development. My primary experience is in data analytics with a business application focus due to my major. I have taken courses in R, SQL, and Python to build technical ability and coding logic. In addition, I have used
Tableau and Microsoft PowerBI academically and professionally for data visualization. This includes primarily of Excel, Access, and R raw data.
Additionally, the Integrated Business and Engineering program has coursework dedicated to the tenets of project management and industrial engineering. Tools such as the quality function deployment, Gantt charts, Kanban boards, and agile/waterfall deployment principles are common-place subjects 
that I use regularly. I have been able to validate my academic knowledge through various internships and job experience the past four years.
